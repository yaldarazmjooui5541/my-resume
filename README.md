## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project is a **Single Page Application (SPA)** designed to showcase my professional profile, skills, and portfolio in a clean, interactive, and visually appealing way.

Built from a customizable open-source template, the codebase has been extensively refactored to incorporate:

- **Component-based architecture:** Modular React components ensure maintainability and scalability.  
- **Responsive design:** Tailwind CSS utility classes guarantee pixel-perfect layouts on all screen sizes.  
- **Smooth scrolling & navigation:** Implemented via programmatic control of DOM elements (`scrollIntoView`) for intuitive section transitions.  
- **Dynamic content rendering:** Easy content updates via React state and props without page reloads.  
- **SEO-friendly routing:** Clean URL structures using React Router or Next.js routing (depending on the setup).  
- **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML and ARIA roles for enhanced usability.
